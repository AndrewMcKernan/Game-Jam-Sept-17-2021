# Game-Jam-Sept-17-2021
The repo for the beginner jam at https://itch.io/jam/level-up-circle-beginner-jam-3


The theme for this game jam is "7". 

You play as the Septopus, an illegally modified octopus with 7 tentacles. 

You must nagivate through 7 mazes, and have 7 attempts to do so - one for each tentacle. 

You have 21 (7*3) seconds to make it through each maze. If you fail, 7 seconds will be added to your timer to give you some extra time.

The mazes are randomly generated each time you play the game. 

All the art assets were made by me. The music was made by Nicole Marie T, found here: https://nicolemariet.itch.io/spy-8-bit-16-bit

Thank you for playing!

This game was made using pygame with the PyCharm Community Edition 2020.2 IDE.
