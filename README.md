# Game-Jam-Sept-17-2021
The repo for the beginner jam at https://itch.io/jam/level-up-circle-beginner-jam-3


The theme for this game jam is "7". 

Here is my idea:

You are a friendly slime, created by the 7th general of the Eternian High Command.

To see whether you will be of use, the Eternian general subjects you to a test.

You must navigate 7 mazes in 77 seconds (or some amount of time related to 7). You will have 7 attempts to navigate all 7 within the time limit. 

Should you fail, you will be executed!

The 7 mazes will be randomly generated, and will be the same for each of your 7 attempts. This should allow you to learn the layout and complete them quickly. 

When you die, you must restart the game, with all new layouts for the 7 mazes.
